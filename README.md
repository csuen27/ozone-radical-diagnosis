# Understanding global terrestrial land surface ozone
This is a demonstrative code collection for research article "Enriching reduced-form diagnostic indicators for surface ozone regulation" newly prepared in 2025 and under review by Nature. 
The original title was "Enriching radical-associated diagnostic indicators facilitates analytical understanding of surface ozone processes".
